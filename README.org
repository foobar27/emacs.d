* Introduction

I'm currently migrating my configuration from [[http://overtone.github.com/emacs-live/][emacs-live]] to a custom [[http://tapoueh.org/emacs/el-get.html][el-get]]
based infrastructure. Some parts of the configuration are directly taken from
emacs-live, but I hope to clean everything up within the next days.

* State of the Project

Don't use it. It's barely tested. I don't know if I will have time to work on
it.

* Installation

Clone the repository into =~/.emacs.d= and copy
[[user.el.example][user.el.example] to =user.el=.

* Some Features

** JavaScript development

JavaScript auto-complete is done via [[http://ternjs.net/][ternjs]]. You should probably create a
=.tern-project= file in your javascript project. Here is an example for an
[[http://angularjs.org/][angularjs]] project:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{
  "libs": [
    "browser",
    "jquery",
    "ecma5",
    "underscore",
    "markdown"
  ],
  "plugins": {
    "angular": "./"
  }
}
#+END_SRC

** C++/CMake development

You should compile your C++-project with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd my-project
mkdir build
CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
#+END_SRC

The you need to put a =.dir-locals.el= file into the root directory of your project:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
((nil . ((cmake-build-directory "/absolute/path/to/build-directory))))
#+END_SRC
